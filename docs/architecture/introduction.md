# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Amazon/Etsy Consulting Agency Website, including frontend systems, third-party integrations, and deployment infrastructure. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This is a **static-first JAMstack architecture** — a Next.js frontend with static export capability, no custom backend, and all dynamic functionality handled through third-party services (booking, forms, email, analytics). This unified approach streamlines development for a modern marketing/consulting website where performance, SEO, and conversion optimization are paramount.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A — Greenfield project**

The PRD specifies a fresh Next.js + Tailwind CSS implementation. No existing codebase or starter template constraints apply. We will establish the project structure and conventions from scratch, optimizing for the specific requirements of this consulting agency website.
