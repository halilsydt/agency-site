# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The website should immediately communicate trust, professionalism, and approachability. Visitors should feel they've found a "different kind of agency"—one that's honest, transparent, and focused on real results rather than hype. The experience should be clean and straightforward: understand services quickly, see proof of results, check pricing, and take action—all without friction, gimmicks, or aggressive sales tactics.

The visual identity balances **friendly approachability** (warm colors, rounded typography, illustrations) with **professional credibility** (clean layout, real data, subtle animations). Users should feel welcomed, not overwhelmed or pressured.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Platform-first navigation**: Primary service discovery through Amazon vs Etsy paths, matching users' mental models
- **Scroll-based storytelling**: Homepage guides visitors through a logical narrative (services → proof → pricing → action)
- **Progressive disclosure**: Overview content with clear paths to deeper information when needed
- **Low-friction conversion**: Simple contact form and embedded calendar booking—no multi-step funnels or lead magnets
- **Sticky navigation**: Persistent header keeps key actions accessible as users scroll
- **Mobile-first interactions**: Touch-friendly elements, hamburger menu, optimized tap targets

## Core Screens and Views

1. **Homepage** — Hero with value proposition, services overview (Amazon/Etsy cards), How It Works, Why Choose Us, Results/Proof, Reviews, Pricing preview, FAQ preview
2. **Amazon Services Page** — Platform-specific landing with all Amazon services listed and described
3. **Etsy Services Page** — Platform-specific landing with all Etsy services listed and described
4. **Pricing Page** — Amazon packages, Etsy packages, bundle discount highlight, transparent pricing display
5. **About Us Page** — Agency story, team, experience, results positioning
6. **Contact Page** — Contact form, consultation booking (calendar embed), email signup
7. **FAQ Page** — Expandable Q&A format for top 5-10 questions
8. **Privacy Policy Page** — Legal compliance content
9. **Terms of Service Page** — Legal compliance content
