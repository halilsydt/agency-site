# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- **Generate qualified leads** through consultation bookings and email signups from serious Amazon/Etsy seller prospects
- **Establish trust and credibility** by positioning the agency as honest, experienced, and results-driven—differentiated from hype-driven competitors
- **Convert visitors to clients** via clear, low-friction paths from landing to contact
- **Provide platform-specific value** by organizing services clearly for Amazon and Etsy sellers with tailored content
- **Demonstrate real results** through anonymized dashboard screenshots and transparent pricing

## Background Context

E-commerce sellers on Amazon and Etsy face significant challenges navigating marketplace complexity, from account setup and listing optimization to advertising and scaling. The consulting market is saturated with agencies making unrealistic promises ("10x your sales overnight!"), leaving sellers skeptical and often burned by overpromises and underdelivery.

This website addresses that trust gap by taking a radically honest approach: real dashboard screenshots showing actual client growth, transparent pricing visible without contact, and realistic messaging focused on practical guidance. The platform-first organization (Amazon Services vs Etsy Services) matches how sellers identify themselves, creating intuitive user journeys for the three target segments: struggling sellers seeking diagnosis, new starters wanting guidance, and growth seekers looking to scale.
