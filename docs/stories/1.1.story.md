# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Configuration

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a fully configured Next.js project with Tailwind CSS and proper tooling,
**so that** I can begin building components with consistent styling and development practices.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Next.js project initialized with TypeScript configuration
2. Tailwind CSS installed and configured with custom theme (colors, fonts, spacing based on PRD branding)
3. ESLint and Prettier configured for code consistency
4. Project structure established (components/, pages/, styles/, public/, content/)
5. Git repository initialized with .gitignore
6. Basic README with project setup instructions
7. `npm run dev` successfully starts development server
8. `npm run build` successfully generates static export

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **Type Everything:** All functions must have explicit TypeScript types; no `any` usage
- **JSDoc Documentation:** All public functions, interfaces, types, and components MUST have JSDoc comments
- **Component Props:** All components must have typed props interfaces
- **Image Handling:** All images via `next/image`; never use raw `<img>` tags
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Components: PascalCase (`ServiceCard.tsx`)
  - Hooks: camelCase with 'use' (`useContactForm.ts`)
  - Types/Interfaces: PascalCase (`Service`, `PricingPackage`)
  - Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE (`MAX_TESTIMONIALS`)

### Brand Theme Configuration
[Source: docs/prd - inferred from Epic 1.2 requirements]

- **Primary Blue:** #2563eb (Tailwind blue-600)
- **Orange Accent:** #f97316 (Tailwind orange-500)
- **Neutrals:** Slate palette
- **Typography:** Rounded sans-serif font (Nunito, Poppins, or Quicksand)
- **Border Radius:** Generous rounded corners for friendly aesthetic

### Testing

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- **Test Location:** `tests/` directory with matching structure
- **Unit Tests:** Vitest + Testing Library
- **E2E Tests:** Playwright in `tests/e2e/`
- **Test Setup:** `tests/setup.ts`

For this story, no tests are required as it's project scaffolding. Testing infrastructure setup (vitest.config.ts, playwright.config.ts) will be verified but tests written in subsequent stories.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-12-03

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Risk Assessment
**Review Depth: Standard** - This is a project scaffolding story with low inherent risk:
- No auth/payment/security code
- No business logic to test
- < 500 lines of meaningful code changes
- First story (no previous gate)
- 8 acceptance criteria (moderate)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall: Excellent** - The implementation is clean, well-organized, and follows modern best practices.

**Strengths:**
- Proper TypeScript configuration with strict mode enabled
- Well-structured Tailwind configuration with brand colors and typography
- Excellent JSDoc documentation in utility files (`lib/utils.ts`, `lib/types.ts`, `lib/content.ts`)
- Clean separation using the `cn()` utility function combining `clsx` + `tailwind-merge`
- Comprehensive README with clear setup instructions
- Dark mode support already configured in `globals.css`

**Observations:**
- Code is minimal and appropriate for scaffolding - no over-engineering
- Directory structure matches architecture spec exactly

### Refactoring Performed

None required - implementation is clean and follows best practices.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ TypeScript strict mode, explicit types, JSDoc on public functions
- Project Structure: ✓ Matches `unified-project-structure.md` exactly
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Test directories created (tests not required for scaffolding story)
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria verified (see details below)

### Acceptance Criteria Verification

| AC | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|----|-------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Next.js + TypeScript | ✓ | `tsconfig.json` with strict mode, Next.js 14.2.33 |
| 2 | Tailwind + brand theme | ✓ | `tailwind.config.ts` with primary (#2563eb), accent (#f97316), Nunito font |
| 3 | ESLint + Prettier | ✓ | `.eslintrc.json`, `.prettierrc` with tailwindcss plugin |
| 4 | Project structure | ✓ | All directories created per spec |
| 5 | Git + .gitignore | ✓ | Standard Next.js ignores, .env*.local included |
| 6 | README | ✓ | Complete with prerequisites, scripts, structure |
| 7 | `npm run dev` | ✓ | Dev server starts successfully |
| 8 | `npm run build` | ✓ | Build passes, static export successful |

### Security Review

**No concerns** - This is scaffolding only. Environment variable patterns are correct:
- `.env.example` contains only `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables (client-safe)
- `.env.local` and `.env*.local` properly gitignored

### Performance Considerations

**No concerns** - Initial bundle sizes are reasonable:
- First Load JS: ~87.2 kB shared + 5.34 kB page-specific
- Using Google Fonts CDN with `display=swap` for FOUT prevention

### Files Modified During Review

None - no modifications required.

### Gate Status

**Gate: PASS** → [docs/qa/gates/1.1-project-setup-and-configuration.yml](../qa/gates/1.1-project-setup-and-configuration.yml)

### Recommended Status

✓ **Ready for Done** - All acceptance criteria met, build passes, no issues found.
