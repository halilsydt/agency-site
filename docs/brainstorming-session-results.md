### Key Structural Decisions:

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Platform-first organization | Clear user journey - "I sell on Amazon" or "I sell on Etsy" |
| Tailored service descriptions per platform | Same service, different context (e.g., Amazon vs Etsy inventory management) |
| No self-identification navigation | Too much cognitive load for visitors |
| No diagnostic quiz | Overcomplicates the experience |
| Bundle pricing on Pricing page | Keeps nav clean, incentivizes larger purchase |

---

## Lead Capture Strategy

### Primary Actions:
1. **Email signup** - For those browsing, not ready to commit
   - Simple: "Leave your email, we'll contact you"
   - No lead magnets or gimmicks
2. **Free consultation booking** - For those ready to talk

### Contact Strategy:
- **FAQ as first line** - Answer common questions before they ask
- **Contact form** - For everything else, respond on your schedule
- No live chat, no phone, no WhatsApp

---

## Trust & Proof Strategy

### What Builds Trust:
- Experience and sales success data
- Realistic experiences and figures (not hype)
- Affordable prices with simple information

### Proof Elements:
| Will Use | Won't Use |
|----------|-----------|
| Dashboard screenshots with real results | Case studies |
| Anonymized growth data | Video testimonials |
| Before/after metrics | Client store names/links |
| Text-based customer reviews | - |

### Brand Positioning:
> "We're NOT the agency that promises '10x your sales overnight!' We ARE the agency that shows real numbers, honest results, practical guidance."

---

## Visual Design Direction

### Overall Feel:
- **Friendly & Approachable** as the base
- Warm colors, rounded edges, approachable feel

| Primary | Blue | Trust, professionalism |
| Accent | Orange | Energy, warmth, CTAs |
| Neutral | White/light gray | Backgrounds, breathing room |

### Typography:
- **Rounded Sans-Serif** fonts
- Soft, approachable letterforms
- Easy to read
- Examples: Nunito, Poppins, Quicksand, Varela Round

### Imagery Strategy:
| Type | Usage |
|------|-------|
| Illustrations | Friendly characters/scenes for approachability |
