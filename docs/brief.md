# Project Brief: Amazon/Etsy Consulting Agency Website

**Created:** 2025-12-03
**Source:** Brainstorming session results
**Status:** Draft

---

## Executive Summary

**Product Concept:** A professional website for an Amazon/Etsy consulting agency that helps sellers start, grow, and optimize their marketplace businesses.

**Primary Problem:** E-commerce sellers on Amazon and Etsy struggle to navigate complex marketplace requirements, optimize their stores, and scale their businesses—while most consulting agencies overpromise with unrealistic "10x sales" claims.

**Target Market:** Amazon and Etsy sellers ranging from new starters needing guidance, struggling sellers seeking diagnosis, to growth seekers wanting optimization.

**Key Value Proposition:** Honest, realistic consulting backed by real results—no hype, just practical guidance with transparent pricing and proven dashboard metrics.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State & Pain Points

**For E-commerce Sellers:**
- **New Starters** face overwhelming complexity—account setup, product research, listing optimization, compliance requirements, and logistics create a steep learning curve
- **Struggling Sellers** have stores but can't diagnose why they aren't making sales—they lack expertise in SEO, advertising, and marketplace algorithms
- **Growth Seekers** hit plateaus and don't know how to scale advertising, expand internationally, or optimize operations
- **International Expanders** face compliance hurdles, tax requirements, and shipping logistics they don't understand

**The Consulting Market Problem:**
- Most agencies use aggressive, unrealistic marketing ("10x your sales!", "6-figure store in 30 days!")
- Sellers get burned by overpromises and underdelivery
- Hard to find trustworthy, transparent consultants who show real results
- Pricing is often hidden or confusing

### Impact of the Problem

- Sellers waste money on ineffective strategies or scam courses
- Legitimate sellers give up due to early failures that were preventable
- Trust in consulting services is low across the industry
- Sellers who need help don't seek it due to past negative experiences

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

| Existing Solution | Why It Fails |
|-------------------|--------------|
| YouTube/Free content | Overwhelming, outdated, no personalized guidance |
| Online courses | One-size-fits-all, no ongoing support |
| Big agencies | Expensive, impersonal, hype-driven marketing |
| Freelancers | Inconsistent quality, limited service range |

### Urgency

- E-commerce continues growing—sellers entering now face more competition than ever
- Amazon and Etsy algorithms constantly change, requiring up-to-date expertise
- Early mistakes (account health issues, bad listings) can have lasting consequences

---

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept

A professional, trust-focused website for an Amazon/Etsy consulting agency that:
- Organizes services by platform (Amazon Services / Etsy Services) for clear user journeys
- Leads with transparency—real dashboard screenshots, honest results, visible pricing
- Converts visitors through low-friction contact (email signup, free consultation booking)
- Builds credibility through proof, not promises

### Key Differentiators

| Our Approach | Competitors |
|--------------|-------------|
| Real anonymized dashboard screenshots showing actual growth | Vague claims and testimonials |
| Transparent pricing visible on website | "Contact us for pricing" |
| Realistic messaging: "practical guidance, honest results" | Hype: "10x your sales overnight!" |
| Platform-specific expertise (tailored to Amazon vs Etsy) | Generic e-commerce advice |
| Simple contact: form + consultation booking | Aggressive sales funnels |

### Why This Solution Will Succeed

1. **Trust Gap Exploitation** — The market is saturated with hype; being honest is now a competitive advantage
2. **Platform-First Organization** — Sellers identify by platform; this matches their mental model
3. **Proof Over Promises** — Dashboard screenshots provide tangible evidence competitors can't fake
4. **Friction-Free Conversion** — No gimmicks, lead magnets, or quizzes—just clear paths to contact
5. **Comprehensive Service Coverage** — From account setup to advertising to troubleshooting, covering the full seller journey

### High-Level Product Vision

A website that immediately communicates:
> "We're the realistic, results-driven agency. Here's proof of what we've done. Here's what it costs. Ready to talk?"

**Visual Identity:** Friendly and approachable (warm colors, rounded typography, illustrations) with professional credibility (clean layout, real data, subtle animations)

**User Experience:** Visitors land → understand services → see proof → check pricing → book consultation or leave email

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Content bottleneck** | High — Launch delays if service descriptions, pricing, and copy aren't ready | Start content creation immediately; prioritize core pages |
| **No dashboard screenshots available** | Medium — Weakens proof/trust strategy without real results to show | Use placeholder approach or delay portfolio section until available |
| **Unclear pricing structure** | High — Can't build pricing page without defined packages | Finalize pricing strategy before development begins |
| **Booking tool integration issues** | Medium — Poor UX if calendar booking doesn't work smoothly | Test multiple tools; have backup options |
| **"No-hype" positioning doesn't convert** | Medium — Being too understated may not compel action | A/B test messaging; balance honesty with compelling CTAs |
| **Limited initial reviews/testimonials** | Low-Medium — Trust section feels thin without social proof | Launch with what's available; actively collect post-launch |
| **Scope creep** | Medium — Adding features delays MVP launch | Strict adherence to MVP scope; defer all "nice to haves" |
